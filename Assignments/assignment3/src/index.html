      <h2>About Fatehgarh Sahib</h2>

      <p>
        Gurdwara Sri Fatehgarh Sahib marks the site of where the two younger sons of Sri Guru Gobind
        Singh ji named <i><strong>Baba Zorawar Singh Ji</strong> (9 years)</i> and
        <i><strong>Baba Fateh Singh Ji</strong> (age 7 years)</i> were bricked alive, tortured and
        beheaded in <time>Decmeber, 1705</time>. The actual site is located in the Bhora Sahib which
        is underneath Gurdwara Sri Fatehgarh Sahib.

      <p>
        In addition to the daily programme of morning and evening services and kirtan, largely
        attended assemblies are held on the first of each Bikrami month. The most notable event of
        the year is a fair, popularly known as Sabha or Shaheedi Jorh Mel, held on 11th, 12th and
        13th of Poh (indian months), which falls during the last week of December, to commemorate
        the martyrdom of Sri Guru Gobind Singh's sons, Sahibzada Zorawar Singh Ji and Sahibzada
        Fateh Singh Ji along with Jagat Mata Gujri Ji.

      <h2>A Brief History Of Events that led to this moment</h2>
      <p>
        As the Sikhs evacuated Anandpur Sahib on the night of 5-6 December 1705, they were closely
        pursued by the very men who had promised them a safe retreat after . Guru Gobind Singh Ji
        had doubted the promises of those who had laid siege to Anandpur, he had even sent out a
        series of wagons to test the attackers' promises. The wagons were attacked soon after they
        had left the safety of the Sikh fortress. It was only after a second promise written on the
        Qur'an and the Holy vedas of the Hindus, which included a guarantee from Aurangzeb himself,
        that the Sikhs and his own family members convinced the Guru to leave Anandpur. Hardly had
        the party reached the ice cold waters of the Rivulet Sarsa then swollen into a raging river
        by the winter's frigid rains when the attackers fell upon the Sikhs. Under cover of a quick
        rearguard action fought on the banks of the river, Guru Gobind Singh Ji and a small band of
        Sikhs succeeded in crossing safely, but the Guru's family were scattered in the tumult. Guru
        Gobind Singh's elderly mother, Mata Gujari, and her two grandsons, Zorawar Singh and Fateh
        Singh, aged 9 and 7 years respectively, had managed to cross the river but they had no where
        to go until one of the families' cooks, named Gangu, offered to take them to his own village
        Kheri.

        They accompanied him to his house, but he proved deceitful and betrayed them to Jam Khan and
        Mani Khan of Morinda. The latter at once despatched them to Sirhind where they were
        consigned to the Thanda Burj (Cold Tower) of the Fort, a place of comfort in the hot summers
        but terribly cold in the winter months. On 9 December 1705, Zorawar Singh and Fateh Singh
        were brought before Wazir Khan, who had just returned from the battle of Chamkaur. Wazir
        Khan tried to lure them to embrace Islam with promises of riches and honours, but they
        spurned the offer. He threatened them with death as an alternative to their accepting Islam,
        but they remained firm. A death sentence was eventually awarded. Nawab Sher Muhammad Khan of
        Malerkotla protested that it would be improper to harm the innocent children. Wazir Khan,
        however, ordered them to be bricked up alive in a wall, if they still refused conversion.
        They were kept in the Cold Tower in that severe winter for another two days. On 11 December
        they, under the orders of Wazir Khan, began to be walled in with bricks while standing on
        the ground. They chose the latter and fearlessly faced the executioner's sword. The cruelty
        of their murder and their fearlessness of death which they preferred to giving up their
        faith. However, as the masonry bricked them alive, the wall was broken and then the
        Sahibzadas were martyred by a dagger on the order of Wazir Khan.

        Then Mata Gujari Ji who had all along been confined in the Cold Tower, only a little
        distance away, breathed her last as the news reached her ears. The dead bodies were kept for
        the night at a spot now called Bimangarh, just outside the fort wall, and were cremated the
        following day by Diwan Todar Mall, a wealthy merchant of Sirhind and the place of their
        cremation is known as Gurdwara Jyoti Saroop Sahib and is located in
